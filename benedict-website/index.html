                        <h2> EARLY LIFE — NORCIA </h2>
                        <p>
                            Saint Benedict was born at Norcia around 480 AD. That historical time frame, a mere four
                            years
                            before the Western Roman Empire formally fell by the deposition of the last Emperor, Romulus
                            Augustulus, was quite difficult. The only authentic life of Saint Benedict is that which is
                            contained in the second book of the Pope Saint Gregory’s Dialogues, probably written between
                            593-594 AD.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After attending primary schools in Norcia, Benedict went to Rome to broaden his knowledge of
                            literature and law. However, since he was probably disgusted by the dissolute lifestyle of
                            his
                            peers and by Rome’s difficult political situation, he retired to Affile with a group of
                            priests,
                            taking his old nurse with him as a servant.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At Affile, Saint Benedict worked his first miracle, restoring to perfect condition an
                            earthenware wheat sifter which his man-servant had accidentally broken. The notoriety which
                            this
                            miracle brought drove Benedict to withdraw further from social life. He took shelter in a
                            cave
                            in the ruins of Nero’s village, near Subiaco, where he began to live as a hermit. Immersed
                            in
                            loneliness, his only contact with the outside world was with a monk called Romanus, whose
                            monastery was nearby. He gave Saint Benedict a monk’s habit and provided for his spiritual
                            and
                            material needs. Three solitary years followed. Some shepherds befriended Benedict. They
                            began to
                            follow his teachings and the pastoral and apostolic principles of the Benedictine Order took
                            root.
                        </p>

                        <h2> FOUNDING MONASTERIES — SUBIACO </h2>
                        <p>
                            After resisting a strong temptation against chastity, Benedict prepared to live through a
                            new
                            experience, following the example of the ancient Fathers of Christian Monasticism. At first,
                            the
                            community of Vicovaro wanted him as its Abbot, but the failed attempt of a monk to poison
                            him
                            forced Benedict to return to his solitude. Afterwards, he founded twelve monasteries and
                            assigned twelve monks to each of them. In addition, he founded a thirteenth monastery for
                            novices and those needing education. Benedict’s fame spread so rapidly, even in Rome, that
                            two
                            illustrious men, Equizius and the nobleman Tertullus, entrusted him with their two sons,
                            Maurus
                            and Placidus. They were to become the first two gems of the Benedictine family.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            During his life, Saint Benedict performed many miracles. He found water on a desolate
                            mountaintop to quench the thirst of his monks. He retrieved a bill hook’s iron from the
                            bottom
                            of a lake and rejoined its handle. He prevented a monk from leading a dissolute life through
                            intervention. In addition, he made Maurus walk on water to save the young Placidus from
                            drowning.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Unfortunately, a priest called Florentius was envious of Benedict’s popularity and his envy
                            forced the Saint to depart in spite of insistence from his disciples. After leaving Subiaco,
                            Benedict went towards Cassino. In the period between 525 and 529 AD he founded the Abbey of
                            Montecassino. It would become the most famous abbey in continental Europe. Under Benedict’s
                            direction, the old acropolis-sanctuary towering above the declined Roman municipium of
                            Casinum
                            was turned into a monastery that was much bigger than those built at Subiaco. On the remains
                            of
                            the altar of Apollo he built a chapel dedicated to Saint John the Baptist, while the temple
                            of
                            Apollo itself was turned into an oratory for the monks which was dedicated to Saint Martin
                            of
                            Tours.
                        </p>

                        <h2> MONASTIC LIFE TAKES ROOT — MONTECASSINO </h2>
                        <p>
                            At Montecassino Saint Benedict displayed prodigious activity. He supervised the building of
                            the
                            monastery, established a monastic order and performed many miracles. He brought back from
                            death
                            a youngster, miraculously supplied the monastery with flour and oil in its time of need and
                            displayed the gift of prophecy. In autumn of 542 AD, while the Goth King Totila was passing
                            through Cassino en route to Naples to attack it, he decided to test Saint Benedict because
                            he
                            had already heard of his gifts and charisms. As a consequence, Totila sent his squire
                            dressed as
                            a king to greet the monk; but Saint Benedict soon unmasked him. When he finally met Totila,
                            he
                            warned him with a dire prediction: “You have hurt many and you continue to do it, now stop
                            behaving badly! You will enter Rome, you will cross the vast sea, you will reign for nine
                            years;
                            however in the tenth year, you will die.” And that is exactly what happened. Saint Benedict
                            showed the same virtue as he cried bitterly when confronted wiht the vision of the first
                            destruction of his monastery. Notwithstanding, he received from God the grace to save all
                            the
                            monks.
                        </p>

                            Saint Benedict devoted himself to evangelizing the local population who practiced pagan
                            worship.
                            Shortly before he died, Saint Benedict saw the soul of his sister Saint Scholastica rising
                            to
                            heaven in the form of a dove. This vision happened a few days after their last talk together
                            at
                            the foot of Montecassino. In a vision, Benedict saw the soul of Bishop Germanus of Capua
                            taken
                            by angels in a fire globe. These visions, for Pope Saint Gregory the Great, showed a close
                            union
                            between Benedict and God, a union so intense that the Saint was given the share of an even
                            more
                            magnificent vision, the whole of creation as gathered in a sunbeam.

                            In the end, a life so noble was justifiably followed by a much-glorified death. According to
                            tradition, Saint Benedict died on March 21, 547 AD. He foresaw his coming death, informing
                            his
                            close and faraway disciples that the end was near. Six days before dying, he had the grave
                            which
                            he was to share with his deceased sister Saint Scholastica, opened. Then, completely
                            exhausted,
                            he asked to be taken into his oratory where, after taking his last Holy Communion, he died
                            supported by his monks.
